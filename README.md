Assignment of Coursera course Practical Machine Learning

Dear reader,
In this repository I included 3 files related to the assignment of the Coursera course Practical Machine Learning:
1) the original Markdown file
2) the PDF output of this file
3) the HTML output of this file
On the HTML file, I did not manage to follow the steps as suggested in the course description, so I am afraid the HTML file does
give the information in a format that is of any use. I therefore suggest to use the PDF file for grading - I hope that works as 
well and appologies for any inconvenience this may cause.

All the best, Perry
